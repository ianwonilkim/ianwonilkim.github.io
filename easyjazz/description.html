  	<h2> About Easy Jazz </h2>
			<p> Easy Jazz is a system that helps people improvise jazz solo without musical knowledge and training. The web-based system allows users to easily access to it without any special equipment or software. The system offers two versions of backing tracks and three types of instrument options. Once the user selects an instrument, the icons of the corresponding instrument appear on the screen. There are nine icons in total, and each of them represents a single note. The user can play the desired note by hovering the cursor of mouse or other compatible input devices over the icon. The notes that the icons represent keep changing adapted to  on the chord of the backing track. Four notes out of them correspond to the chord tones and are displayed as large icons.  </p>
