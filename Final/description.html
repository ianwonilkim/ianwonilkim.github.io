  	<h2> About Easy Jazz </h2>
			<p> If you want improvisation, you need to know about music theory. However music theory isn't easy to understand. Even if you know music theory, the instruments must be part of you in order to improvise. This process takes a very long time. But, with 'easy jazz', you can play jazz "right away". </p>


	<h2> How to play? </h2>
			<p> First, there are three types of instruments: electric guitar saxophone and piano. You can choose what you want. Now, prepare yourself and press the play button. When the song comes out, move the mouse over the instrument. Oh!, do not you know chords and scales? Do not worry about it! Easy jazz does not need to know it. <br><br>
			Here is one tip! The large size of the notes is the chord tone. You can play "jazz" sounds using chord tones. Press the Rewind button to move to the start position. You can also skip the bar by pressing the Forward button. Is the same song boring? You can even change the song! Press Vinyl Records.</p>
